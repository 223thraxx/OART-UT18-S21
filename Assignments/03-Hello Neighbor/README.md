# 03-Hello Neighbor

### Assignment
This weeks exercise is to create a game using Blinks as neighbors as a core mechanic of the game. Once again, recall elements of play from playground games that can be incorporated here, remember that the Blink is just a game piece and that it can be used to facilitate play.

This is a good opportunity to play with and explore the communication between Blinks, but also a good opportunity to work with the physical affordances of the system. Think of how ZenFlow and Heist each use communicating with their neighbors in very different ways.
