Communication Game

I barely know how to code and could barely make anything

GAME INSTRUCTIONS: TRY TO MAKE WHOLE COLORS (all faces same). START THEM OFF CONNECTED IS ONLY REQUIREMENT. 

ISSUES: DOMINANT COLORS DON'T WORK. SOMETIMES A BLUE AND BLUE WILL TOUCH AND MAKE RED FOR EXAMPLE. 

1. FIRST TRIED TO MAKE IT SO OPPOSITE COLORS COULD ONLY INTERFACE WITH EACH OTHER (RED VS BLUE). COULD NOT FIGURE THAT OUT. 

2. THEN, TRIED TO MAKE IT SO AN OPPOSITE COLOR WOULD ONLY CHANGE IF IT WAS SURROUNDED BY 2 OPPOSITE COLORS (IF A RED BORDERED 2 BLUES, IT WOULD TURN BLUE) COULD NOT FIGURE THAT OUT.

3. FINALLY ENDED UP WITH A SCUFFED VERSION WHERE RED'S TURN BLUE AND BLUE'S TURN RED AND SOMETIMES BLUE'S ON BLUE'S TURN RED AND RED AND RED TURNS BLUE. ONLY SALVAGEBLE GAME IS TO MAKE IT SO YOU MUST CONSTRUCT WHOLE BLINKS (ALL SAME COLOR). 

4. Very lost on blinks communication in general and some more time on this topic I think would be valuable.
