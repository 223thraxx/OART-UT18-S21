Hello World Documentation
During the assignment hello world, the first thing I wanted to try doing was use shadings of the same color to amplify the emotions conveyed out of a single color. For instance, I wanted to show the power and strength out of the color red through different shades of dark red.

Unfortunately as I noticed creating this idea, I found out that slight variations in colors don’t work too well on the Blinks (ie.  When choosing between a crimson red, a strong vibrant red, and a dark red, they all showed up almost identical on the blinks).

With this in mind, I realized the single color idea wasn’t going to work. I was going to have to find an idea that used more variety in color to represent an emotion. I started to think of colors in everyday objects that could represent emotions: the serenity of the sky, the warmth and comfort of a fireplace, the bustling of a busy streetlight, ect. Ultimately I decided on a fireplace, as I believed it would be best represented through the color variation on the Blinks.
