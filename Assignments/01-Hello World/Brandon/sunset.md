# Static
For the first portion of the assignment I wanted to try to capture the sort of peaceful joy one might experience while viewing a sunset.
My thought process was that I could utilize the cloudy plastic that covers the blink to diffuse the colors of the palette I selected to represent a sunset.

# Dynamic
As a continuation from the static part of the assignment, I used sunset as the basis for displaying emotion dynamically. After swapping into dynamic mode, there is an animated sunset.
Eventually, everthing will fade to black and the Moon will rise.

## Controls
Long Press the blink to swap between static and dynamic viewing.
While in dynamic mode, double press the blink to reset the sunset animation.
