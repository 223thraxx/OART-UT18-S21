## Joon - Hello World

### Static
For static, I wanted to make a emotion of calm and hope.
To express that emotion, I decided to use the spectrum of Green color that represent calmness and hope.
However, the blinks were not as sensitive to colors as expected, which didn't create a straightforward spectrum, but the color difference is still present.

### Dynamic
For dynamic emotion, I decided to represent how any person's heart can be damaged by small things.
First there is a pure heart with blue color. Every time you press a button, things will happen to the heart. It will get damaged and as those damage
stacks on top of each other that human's pure heart will break. Turning blood red.
