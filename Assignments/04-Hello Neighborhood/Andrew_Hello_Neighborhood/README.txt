I returned to the basic challenges of commmunication and attempted to create communication between 2 blinks, 3 blinks, 4 blinks, 5 blinks. 

I was able too successfully do communication between 1 blink and a neighbor and communication between 1 blink and 2 neighbors. Scaling beyond that, I could not understand how to do such things. 

Basically, when a white and white collide (face 1 & 1), it sets its red face (face 2) active as well so that it can go around and activate all of the other reds. I believe this satisfies sending a value to two neighbors...because there are cases if you align it next to a white faced neighbor and a red faced neighbor they will both change color...

I don't know if setValue + getLastValue functions are ideal for building to program 3 + 4...
