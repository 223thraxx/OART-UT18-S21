Puzzle Game

I have made a puzzle game where you must remember a pattern and then remember the color green's place in that pattern. 
So, if green shows up in the second position, you must tap twice to signifiy the seocond position, and so on...

The biggest challenge in the process of making it was finding a way to implement random patterns. 
I had to figure out how to use "while" statements to make it so the colors would not repeat. Thankfully, I have
a talented C programming wizard as my roomate. 

Currently, everything is working except for feedback that you failed to to choose the right spot. The blinks 
turns green if you select the right spot, but does nothing if you select the wrong spot. I tried to make it
turn red, but it never worked for some reason. I have no idea why. The IF statements would only work for the true case.
