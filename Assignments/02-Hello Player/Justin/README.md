Hello Player Documentation

For the assignment Hello Player, immediately I decided that I wanted to do a “time accuracy game” because I think that is one area where the dynamic display of the Blinks can really shine. I ended up creating a game in which a single blink piece slowly starts blinking blue until the blink is finally filled out. At that point the player must press the button and if they win, the Blink will turn yellow, otherwise turning red.

It’s a fairly simple game for sure, but with the added variation of randomness, it makes the game unique every time you play as the number of time it takes to fill the circle is random every time.
